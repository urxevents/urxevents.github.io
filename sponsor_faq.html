                    <dt>How can I sponsor or exhibit at a URx event?</dt>
                    <dd>Please <a href="http://urxconference.com/pages/sponsor-interest">complete our sponsorship form</a>, and include the event you’re interested in sponsoring and whether you’re interested in a specific opportunity. We’d be happy to help you find the opportunity that best fits your goals.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>What will you need after I’ve committed to a sponsorship opportunity?</dt>
                    <dd>Once you’ve signed and returned our sponsor agreement, we’ll ask for&#58; a high-resolution (preferably vector) logo in both full color and single color, a URL we can use for our site and event materials, and a 200-character description of your company. If you’ve selected a lounge, interactive hangout, or swag bag add-on, we’ll set up a kickoff to discuss the execution of your sponsorship.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Do you offer discounts if I commit to more than one event this year?</dt>
                    <dd>We’d love to see you at multiple events this year! Supporting multiple events shows a deep commitment to the URx Community and we would certainly recognize that. Any discount is based on the level of sponsorship and opportunities selected.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>I am interested in multiple events, but I can only commit to one right now. Will you still honor the multi-event discount?</dt>
                    <dd>We can apply the multi-event discount at the time your second event is booked. Unfortunately, we can’t extend a retroactive discount to past events.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>The sponsorship I want is listed as “sold out”. Is there anything I can do?</dt>
                    <dd>We can always add you to a waitlist and reach out if a similar opportunity becomes available. We’d also be happy to discuss custom options that meet your needs.</dd>

                    <dd>Each sponsorship comes with a different set of benefits and perks. All sponsorships include&#58; a logo with linked URL on the event website, logo placement in communications to attendees before and after the event, logo placement on signage at the event, and complimentary tickets (quantities based on sponsorship level).</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Do I get to speak at the event if I sponsor?</dt>
                    <dd>Speaking opportunities are not guaranteed with sponsorship, but we highly encourage sponsors to  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoenlkZxOKWu7bMfjYgmdwWvpWBNr55evpRx2WjYnaHxcjrg/viewform">submit a speaker proposal</a> when submissions are open.</dd> We also have dedicated blocks in our event program to highlight sponsors  at certain sponsor levels. 
                    
                    <dt>Will I be able to demo my product at the event?</dt>
                    <dd>Certain sponsorships include lounges and exclusive space for you to use to demo your product or take private meetings.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Can you offer additional tickets to the conference beyond what comes with my sponsorship?</dt>
                    <dd>Beyond the complimentary tickets included with your sponsorship, we offer a discount on additional tickets. Just let us know if you’d like to request additional tickets.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Do I need to handle the production of anything for my sponsorship?</dt>
                    <dd> Unless otherwise noted, we take care of everything related to the production of your event presence. If you’ve selected an art installation, interactive hangout, or swag bag add-on, we’d love for you to be involved in the creative process for your design, and we’ll take care of the rest.</dd>
