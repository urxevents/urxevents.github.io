                            <p>Recognizing that science enables exploration, and exploration enables science, NASA created the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) to address basic and applied scientific questions fundamental to understanding the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and the moons of Mars. Primarily using virtual tools to communicate has eliminated the need for a traditional bricks and mortar institute, allowing the hundreds of researchers across the U.S. and the nine international partners to easily communicate and collaborate, from wherever they are. The small, central office located at NASA Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley, coordinates the institute activities.  Newly found synergies across the teams, the sharing of data and facilities, and the ease of communication increase the efficiencies of scientific discovery. More importantly, the birth of ideas formed at the intersection of disparate disciplines can readily be pursued by groups that might not otherwise have formed, or even met! SSERVI follows on the heels of the highly successful NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI), a virtual institute dedicated solely to studies of the Moon.  Pendleton directed the NLSI from 2010-2013 when it was expanded to become SSERVI. The creation of SSERVI has not only expanded our knowledge of the Earth’s nearest neighbor to include other stepping-stones to Mars, but also furthered our ability to address the scientific and technological questions we need to know…before we go!</p>

                            <p>Pull Requests are one of most essential workflow pieces of modern application development. If used effectively with proper code review and your existing workflow, they can not only help ensure high quality of written code, but do so without sacrificing the speed of development.</p>
                            <p>We'll start out by looking at what makes a great pull request, and what barriers people have with sending and receiving them. Next, we'll remove some of those barriers by discussing some code review best practices to ensure the code we're writing is well written and well tested. Lastly, we'll see how and why these pieces are a crucial part of a proper workflow, and what advantages the GitHub Flow has.</p>

                            <p>As teams grow, there is often a temptation to add more process around shipping code in an effort to make it safer. We are attempting to build an alternate approach — use flexible tools to enable engineers who write the code to also ship their code quickly and safely. Our tooling deeply integrates SCM, builds, and deploys to guide engineers through the deploy process. Come see what we’ve built, how it’s working, and how we plan to continue improving it.</p>

The project has delivered an amazing impact for many companies, including Facebook, thanks to these efforts. This session will guide the audience through the lesser known parts of designing security software: building community trust, managing build & deployment, dogfooding, and empathy. We will use security related features and capabilities as examples.

                            <p>Enabling two-factor authentication is an important step in securing your accounts on the web. Traditional two-factor technologies, requiring you to type in a code from your phone, are a hassle and have numerous security shortcomings. A recently published standard from the FIDO Alliance, Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is the next step in the evolution of account security. Through tightly integrating hardware tokens like the YubiKey, the web browser, and websites like GitHub, U2F provides an easier and more secure way to lock down your web accounts. Speakers from Yubico and GitHub will discuss how U2F works, how it improves the security and user experience of two-factor authentication, and why and how GitHub chose to adopt this new standard.</p>

                            <p>Making movies is a complex, collaborative, creative activity. At Pixar, they don't pretend to know exactly what they're doing, but they do have a process. They trust the process, but they constantly test and refine it, based on the stories they want to tell, the resources they have to tell them, and most importantly - the people who want to tell them.</p>
                            <p>Technology and art go hand in hand at Pixar - each challenges and reinforces the other. Technologist Michael B. Johnson, a Pixarian since he joined as an intern in 1993, has been involved in most of Pixar's feature films and short films. He will share his perspective on the Pixar film-making process; one which involves both creative story tellers that want things they don't understand how to make and flexible technologists who are more concerned with empowering their users than winning an argument with them.</p>
                            <p>Come along as Michael tells stories from inside their process; sharing the how and the why. Join him as he tries to explain how Pixar always manages to keep their eye on the big prize - a compelling story, well told.</p>

                            <p>Autodesk is moving hundreds of Perforce repositories to GitHub. I present the process how we move these repositories, what problems we encountered so far and how we solved them.</p>
                            <p>I will cover how I discovered and fixed issues with paths and encodings. In addition I will present new function that I came up with, such as the option to migrate huge binaries directly to Git LFS. I also will present our best practices how to split repositories, how to deal with 3rd party components, how to migrate branches, and how to deal with UTF-16/Unicode text files in a cross platform Git environment as Git can only handle UTF-8 text files by default.</p>
                            <p>The audience will get an extensive overview how to migrate source code from Perforce to GitHub. Equipped with this knowledge they will be able to estimate the risk for a Perforce to Git migration and their own migration will be a breeze.</p>

                            <p>Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed. But the risk of moving this quickly is that things break in production and users abandon your buggy application. To stay competitive, you can't just ship fast - you also have to solve for quality.</p>
                            <p>In this session, we'll help you rethink what it means to actively monitor your application in production so your team can ship fast with confidence. With the right tooling, workflow, and organizational structures in place, you don't have to sacrifice release times or stability. When things break, you'll be able to fix errors before they impact your users.</p>

                            <p>Electron is an open source library from GitHub that allows you to create desktop applications on three operating systems with HTML, CSS and JS rather than system-specific languages. This session will be two-part: an introduction to Electron and its ecosystem, followed by a talk and demonstration from Jibo, a team using Electron to animate a first-of-its-kind home robot.</p>

                            <p>At Spotify, my team struggled to be awesome. We had a very loose understanding of what product/service our squad was responsible for, and even less so of the expectations our internal and external customers had for those services. Other than “does our Facebook login work?”, we had no understanding of how our services we’re responsible for were doing. How many users actually sign up or log in with Facebook? How many users have connected their Spotify account with their Uber account? Do folks even use Spotify with Uber?</p>
                            <p>With a 2-month challenge period, my squad and I focused inward to establish those unanswered questions and to establish feedback loops and always-on dashboards. This talk will tell the story of how we chose which metrics are important for us to focus on, what technologies we have used and are using, and how we’ve iterated over our feedback loops to fine-tune what metrics we care about.</p>

                            <p>What do these secrets look like to someone who works at GitHub? There are a few ways to answer. In teaching others how to use Git and GitHub, we have found certain useful, well-documented features remain under-appreciated and under-used. In building GitHub, we have developed a few techniques for using the platform with maximum efficiency. This session aims to cover both "types" of secrets, with a bias for the practical over the esoteric.</p>

                            <p>GitHub Pages is a simple web host for static assets. And Offline Web Apps are designed to work well on devices without persistent network connections (and thus no hard dependencies on dynamic server-side logic).</p>
                            <p>Which means GitHub Pages would be a great place to host Offline Web Apps, if there was a way for them to ensure they'll be cached despite not having control over the web server configuration. Service Workers provides that missing piece.</p>
                            <p>Come see how Offline Web Apps hosted on GitHub Pages can use Service Workers to cache themselves consistently and persistently, including automatic, silent, and incremental updates, with graceful degradation on browsers that don't support them.</p>
                            <p>You'll learn what Service Workers are, find out how to integrate them into Grunt and Gulp toolchains, and see demos of Offline Web Apps on GitHub Pages surviving page reloads and browser restarts on disconnected devices.</p>
